// Circle wearing workers are the lowest ranking, they must answer to their superiors and can "only speak when spoken to".

// Triangles are placed on the middle rung of the Squid Game hierarchy â€“ they act as armed soldiers.

// Squares are effectively the bosses within the worker's group, they keep their fellow triangles and circles in check and call the shots.

// Of course, all the pink suited workers answer to the Front Man!
